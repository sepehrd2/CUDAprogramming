# CUDA programming

I worked on multiple CUDA kernels capable of executing different
algorithms on GPU. The written kernels include: 1- vector addition,
2- matrix multiplication, 3- tiled matrix multiplication, using
shared memory, 4- 3D convolution, using constant memory for the mask,
5- reduction list, 6- parallel prefix-sim, 7- histogram, employing
atomic operation, and 8- sparse matrix multiplication.
